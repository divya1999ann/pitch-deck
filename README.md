# Automatic Pitch Deck Creator
PitchPoint, a web-based platform where entrepreneurs can enter information to the specific, relevant questions based on what potential investors (banks, trust-funds etc. ) expect from start-ups.

Building on the answers to these questions, a pitch-deck will be automatically generated, which will be a finished presentation conveying the entrepreneurâ€™s ideas, but in a form that investors will understand and love.
